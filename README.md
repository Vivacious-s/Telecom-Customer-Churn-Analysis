# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis – Python + Power BI

## Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges in the telecom industry.
This project analyzes customer behavior and identifies key factors driving churn using **Python for data analysis** and **Power BI for visualization**.

The goal is to help the telecom company **reduce churn and improve customer retention** by uncovering actionable insights.

 🗂️ Dataset
Source: Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)
Rows:~7,043
Columns: 21

🔍 Data Analysis (Python)

Performed in Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

#Key Insights

   * Customers on month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate
   * Electronic check users churn the most among payment types
   * Long-tenure customers show strong loyalty
   * Senior citizens and those **without dependents** are more likely to churn

 📈 Power BI Dashboard

After analyzing in Python, the cleaned dataset was imported into Power BI to create an interactive dashboard.
